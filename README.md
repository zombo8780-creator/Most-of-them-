# Venice Skills

Agent Skills for the [Venice API](https://docs.venice.ai). Skills are self-contained folders of instructions (one `SKILL.md` each) that an LLM agent loads on demand to work correctly against a specific surface area of the API.

This repository is the canonical source of truth for Venice skills and is kept in sync with [`swagger.yaml`](https://docs.venice.ai). Use it with Cursor, Claude, Codex, Cline, or any other agent runtime that supports the Agent Skills format.

## What's in here

```
skills/        One folder per skill, each with a SKILL.md
template/      Copy this as a starting point for a new skill
```

## Using these skills

Each skill is just a folder with a `SKILL.md` that starts with YAML frontmatter:

```yaml
---
name: venice-chat
description: …when the agent should load this skill and what's in it…
---
```

### Cursor

Clone or subtree the repo and point your agent skills path at `skills/`:

```bash
# project-local
git clone git@github.com:veniceai/skills.git .cursor/skills-venice
# or copy individual skills
cp -r skills/venice-chat .cursor/skills/
```

### Claude / Codex / OpenCode / Hermes / other runtimes

The `SKILL.md` format is a shared spec — drop the `skills/` folder (or any subset) into whichever path your runtime watches:

| Runtime | Project-local | Global |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Code | `.claude/skills/` | `~/.claude/skills/` |
| Codex | `.codex/skills/` | `$CODEX_HOME/skills/` (default `~/.codex/skills/`) |
| OpenCode | `.opencode/skills/` (also reads `.claude/skills/` + `.agents/skills/`) | `~/.config/opencode/skills/` |
| Hermes Agent (Nous Research) | `$HERMES_OPTIONAL_SKILLS_DIR` | `~/.hermes/skills/` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/skills/` | `~/.cursor/skills/` |
| Cline | `.clinerules/skills/` | n/a |
| Any other runtime | `.agents/skills/` (convention) | `~/.agents/skills/` |

One-liner install for most setups:

```bash
# clone once
git clone https://github.com/veniceai/skills.git ~/src/venice-skills

# symlink into every runtime you use
ln -s ~/src/venice-skills/skills ~/.claude/skills/venice
ln -s ~/src/venice-skills/skills ~/.codex/skills/venice
ln -s ~/src/venice-skills/skills ~/.config/opencode/skills/venice
ln -s ~/src/venice-skills/skills ~/.hermes/skills/venice
```

The agent discovers each `SKILL.md` by its frontmatter `name` + `description` and loads it on demand. Runtimes that define extra frontmatter fields (`version`, `platforms`, `metadata.*`, `compatibility`, …) are required by spec to **ignore unknown fields**, so the same skill file works everywhere without forks.

> **NanoCoder** and similar minimal coding agents (Claw-Code, etc.) don't ship their own skills runtime — they piggyback on whichever host agent (Claude Code, OpenCode, Hermes) is driving them. Install the skills in the host and NanoCoder will see them automatically.

### As a git submodule

```bash
git submodule add git@github.com:veniceai/skills.git vendor/venice-skills
```

Then symlink or copy the subsets you want into your agent's skill path.

## Authoring a new skill

1. Copy `template/` to `skills/<your-skill-name>/`.
2. Fill in the frontmatter and body. Keep the `description` concrete — it's what an agent uses to decide when to load the skill.
3. Link related skills at the bottom of the `SKILL.md` for cross-navigation.
4. Open a PR.

See [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](./CONTRIBUTING.md) for style conventions (short first paragraph, explicit endpoint tables, curl + one SDK example, "gotchas" section, ≤ 500 lines).

## Source of truth

Skills are derived from the current Venice OpenAPI spec and public docs at <https://docs.venice.ai>. When the spec changes, update the affected skills and cut a release.

## Authentication quick reference

| Mode | Header | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Bearer API key** | `Authorization: Bearer <key>` | Venice Pro account, consumes DIEM / USD / bundled credits. |
| **x402 / SIWE wallet** | `X-Sign-In-With-X: <base64 SIWE>` | No account required, pay per request with USDC on Base (chain `8453`). |

See [`skills/venice-auth`](./skills/venice-auth/SKILL.md) for full signing details.

## Staying in sync with the API

The skills are derived from the Venice OpenAPI spec. Run the sync script to diff the currently-published spec against the endpoints and model-type enums referenced in each `SKILL.md`:

```bash
python scripts/sync_from_swagger.py --spec https://api.venice.ai/doc/api/swagger.yaml
# or against a local copy
python scripts/sync_from_swagger.py --spec ./swagger.yaml
```

The script prints:

- endpoints in the spec that no skill references yet,
- endpoints referenced in skills but missing from the spec (stale docs),
- model-type enum drift (e.g. new `type=…` value added).

CI runs this nightly; any drift is filed as an issue with the `sync` label.
